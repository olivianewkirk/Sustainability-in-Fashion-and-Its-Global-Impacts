As an avid fashion lover and someone who enjoys thrifting and secondhand shopping, I’m very aware of the negative effects of fast fashion, and I want more insight on how exactly fast fashion impacts our environment. The sustainable fashion movement has seemed to quickly gain popularity after the general public was made aware of the horrors that go on in the fast fashion industry, with multiple factors contributing to the crisis. Child labor, extremely quick trend cycles, harmful chemicals released in the environment, and clothing ending up in the landfill are just a few of the byproducts that the fast fashion industry has and continues to produce. As of 2025, the fast fashion industry is worth approximately $150 billion. In comparison, the sustainable fashion market is only worth about $10 billion. That’s a 1500% difference between industries. Although fast fashion is huge in the world right now, I want to understand what exactly is the driving force behind either sustainability or wasteful fashion.
